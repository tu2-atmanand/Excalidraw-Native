## TODO

Finally to start with something i now got some idea to edit in this, this is the way i gonna learn now the javascipt code, for now this idea will only to change the layout and all i think :

1. On the bottom left there are buttons remove only keep Erase from that and put it in the main top tool bar.
2. move the top Toolbar on right side in middle.
3. remove the bottom right help button and put at the last of top toolbar.
4. Add Slider to change the font size, to get any size.
5. RIght Click and Hold for pan.

#### High feature

1. Create a color picker.

#### Final Big thing after All modification

Converting This Project into React Native Project, even maybe for Mobile.

## Analysis

1. I found when i move the pan and editing and all it is taking 60% CPU and temp is 60, but obviously this is because of development environment code and all. After final Build, even for Native it will be cool.
